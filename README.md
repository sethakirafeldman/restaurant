The purpose of this is to serve as a Vanilla JS Single-page application, where the relevant parts of the DOM are replaced depending on the selected page. 

This was also an exercise in modular programming, whereas each page has its own function that runs to render it. 

And finally, it was bundled using Webpack to minifiy the code and deployed to and hosted by GitHub pages.
